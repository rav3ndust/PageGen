# PageGen by rav3ndust

generates HTML and CSS files for you to easily automate the beginnings of a .html and .css template that you can edit to your liking. 

# the low-down

PageGen aims to help you build out the bare bones of an HTML file and CSS stylesheet in a few seconds flat. You answer a few questions the script gives you, and then it generates your HTML and CSS files to your specifications. Once it's done, you can go back and edit the files further to achieve more complex results, or just simply add in your content.

I use this script at the moment to quickly generate HTML files for my websites, but I would like to continue developing it further so it can easily help anyone who is frequently building web pages.

# Where do the generated files go? 

When you run the script, it will create a folder called "/www "in your home directory where it will store your HTML and CSS files. You can come here and move them
around as you wish.
